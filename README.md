Hi there! I’m f0r3ns1c N1nj4 from Cyberus Technologies. I’ve dedicated my career to keeping systems safe and responding to cyber attacks, which can be quite challenging but incredibly rewarding. While my main focus has been on defensive security, I also have a genuine passion for offensive strategies. I believe that understanding the "attacker's mindset" not only helps me better protect against threats but also keeps my work exciting. It’s all about making the digital world a safer place for everyone!
